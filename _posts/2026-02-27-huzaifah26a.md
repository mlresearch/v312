title: 'Latent-RQ: Enhancing Speech Pre-training with Latent Representations and Random
  Quantization'
abstract: Random quantization is a simple yet effective strategy for speech self-supervised
  pre-training, producing strong encoder representations for a range of downstream
  tasks. However, existing methods such as BEST-RQ rely on Mel spectrograms – low-level
  acoustic features – as quantizer inputs, which may hinder convergence and limit
  target quality. We propose Latent-RQ, an extension that replaces direct Mel inputs
  with richer latent representations extracted from a pre-trained encoder. To further
  enhance target quality, the target encoder is periodically updated during training.
  Latent-RQ achieves consistent improvements on the SUPERB benchmark, particularly
  for speech recognition and speaker identification, while reaching comparable performance
  to BEST-RQ with fewer optimization steps under a fixed training budget. We also
  analyze how target layer selection influences downstream performance and layer-wise
  information encoding. t-SNE visualizations of phoneme and speaker embeddings reveal
  clearer clustering and improved target discriminability. Overall, Latent-RQ offers
  a scalable and effective enhancement to random quantization-based SSL frameworks
  for speech representation learning.
