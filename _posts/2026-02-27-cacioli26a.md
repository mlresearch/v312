title: Can You Hear Naples? Building and Benchmarking a Neapolitan Speech Corpus
abstract: 'This paper presents the creation and analysis of the first spoken corpus
  for Neapolitan, a richly historic but under-resourced Romance dialect of Southern
  Italy. Despite its cultural importance, Neapolitan has been largely omitted from
  computational resources, limiting both dialectological research and the development
  of equitable speech technologies. We address this gap by creating the first structured
  spoken resource for Neapolitan, enabling systematic evaluation of dialectal ASR
  performance. Each clip was manually transcribed in orthographic Neapolitan and automatically
  aligned using OpenAI’s Whisper API, configured for standard Italian. To figure out
  how well Whisper transcribed the spoken Neapolitan sentences, we checked the outputs
  against the correct human-written texts using a few different methods. Specifically,
  we looked at how often the words matched (BLEU), how different the transcriptions
  were overall (normalized Levenshtein distance), and how closely the sets of words
  lined up (Jaccard similarity). We also used Word Error Rate (WER), but to make it
  easier to interpret, we converted it to similarity by subtracting from one (1–WER).
  A higher value means the transcription was more accurate. On average, this similarity
  measure came out very low, around 0.1306 ($\sigma$ = 0.1654), meaning roughly 87
  percent of the words were transcribed incorrectly. The other evaluation measures
  told the same story: normalized Levenshtein similarity averaged around 0.6360, and
  Jaccard similarity was just 0.1078. This paper makes three crucial steps: (1) developed
  an easy-to-follow process anyone can use to build similar datasets for other dialects,
  (2) released the first openly accessible Neapolitan speech corpus, and (3) demonstrated
  just how critical it is to build ASR systems specifically trained on dialects, supporting
  not just computational linguistic research but also efforts to preserve these unique
  languages.'
