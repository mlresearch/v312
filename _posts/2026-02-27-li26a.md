title: Semi-supervised Acoustic Scene Classification under Spatial-Temporal Variability
  with a CRNN-based Model
abstract: In this work, we present MobileASCNet, a lightweight CRNN-based model designed
  for acoustic scene classification (ASC) under spatial-temporal variability, as defined
  in the APSIPA ASC 2025 Grand Challenge. The model combines depthwise separable convolutions
  and ResNet-inspired residual blocks for efficient spatial feature extraction, and
  employs a gated recurrent unit (GRU) branch to capture temporal dependencies. City
  and time embeddings are fused to enhance context-awareness. We conduct extensive
  comparisons under different training strategies, including training from scratch,
  pretraining with fine-tuning, and feature freezing. Without relying on knowledge
  distillation, MobileASCNet achieves a competitive classification accuracy on the
  development set, with low model complexity.
