title: Online Independent Low-Rank Matrix Analysis as a Lightweight and Trainable
  Model for Real-Time Multichannel Music Source Separation
abstract: In this paper, we propose an online extension of independent low-rank matrix
  analysis (ILRMA) for blind music source separation under real-time constraints.
  Because multitrack stems are rarely released, we target lightweight processing that
  operates directly on in-the-wild mixtures. The method combines an online Itakura–Saito
  nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) update with an online auxiliary-function
  independent vector analysis (IVA) framework, preserving the low-rank spectral model
  employed in ILRMA while updating the demixing matrix frame by frame with bounded
  latency and memory. Simulations on multitrack music mixtures show improved separation
  accuracy and a real-time factor below one, indicating feasibility for live and interactive
  scenarios. These results suggest blind separation suitable for low-latency music
  applications.
