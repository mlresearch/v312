title: 'AudioRAG: A Challenging Benchmark for Audio Reasoning and Information Retrieval'
abstract: Due to recent advancements in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) that demonstrate
  remarkable performance across a range of sound-, speech- and music-related tasks,
  there is a growing interest in proposing benchmarks to assess these models. Existing
  benchmarks generally focus only on reasoning with internal knowledge, neglecting
  real-world scenarios that require external information grounding. To bridge this
  gap, we introduce AudioRag, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate audio-based reasoning
  augmented by information retrieval in realistic web environments. This benchmark
  comprises both LLM-generated and manually curated question-answer pairs. Our evaluations
  reveal that even the state-of-the-art LALMs struggle to answer these questions.
  We therefore propose an agentic pipeline that integrates audio reasoning with retrieval-augmented
  generation, providing a stronger baseline for future research.
