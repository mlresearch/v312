title: Train multi-modal LLM to understand diverse speech paralinguistics by distilling
  from teacher with meta-information prompt
abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) can be extended for input audio, by expressing
  the audio embeddings as an interpretable prompt to the LLM. The adaptor that computes
  these audio embeddings is often trained using multi-modal Instruction Fine-Tuning
  (IFT) data. It is labour intensive to scale up the creation of such data to many
  datasets, tasks, and audio information types. The labour can be reduced with Knowledge
  Distillation (KD), by prompting an external teacher LLM with meta-information from
  the audio dataset, and using the teacher’s output as a reference to train a student
  that is now prompted with the audio. Prior KD work has only used a few datasets,
  and does not present experiment comparisons against fair choices of IFT models.
  This paper scales up KD to a larger collection of datasets, comprising a wider variety
  of meta-information types. Fair experiment comparisons on Dynamic-SUPERB and AudioBench
  show that KD and IFT are complementary, but KD alone may not outperform IFT.
