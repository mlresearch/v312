title: 'AudioBERTScore: Objective Evaluation of Environmental Sound Synthesis Based
  on Similarity of Audio Embedding Sequences'
abstract: We propose a novel objective evaluation metric for synthesized audio in
  text-to-audio generation (TTA), aiming to improve the performance of TTA models.
  In TTA, subjective evaluation of synthesized sounds is important; however, conducting
  it requires significant monetary and time costs. Therefore, objective evaluation
  such as mel-cepstral distortion are used, but the correlation between these objective
  metrics and subjective evaluation values is weak. Our proposed objective evaluation
  metric, AudioBERTScore, calculates the similarity between embedding of the synthesized
  and reference sounds. The method is based not only on the max-norm used in conventional
  BERTScore but also on the p-norm to reflect the non-local nature of environmental
  sounds. Experimental results show that scores obtained by the proposed method have
  a higher correlation with subjective evaluation values than conventional metrics.
