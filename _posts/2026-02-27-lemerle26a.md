title: 'Lina-Speech: Gated Linear Attention and Initial-State Tuning for Multi-Sample
  Prompting Text-To-Speech Synthesis'
abstract: 'Neural codec language models, built on transformer architecture, have revolutionized
  text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, excelling in voice cloning by treating it as a prefix
  continuation task. However, their limited context length limits their effectiveness
  to short speech samples. As a result, the voice cloning ability is restricted to
  a limited coverage and diversity of the speaker’s prosody and style. Besides, adapting
  prosody, accent, or appropriate emotion from a short prefix remains a challenging
  task. Finally, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limits inference throughput.
  In this work, we introduce Lina-Speech, a TTS model with Gated Linear Attention
  (GLA) to replace standard self-attention as a principled backbone, improving inference
  throughput while matching state-of-the-art performance. Leveraging the stateful
  property of recurrent architecture, we introduce an Initial-State Tuning (IST) strategy
  that unlocks the possibility of multiple speech sample conditioning of arbitrary
  numbers and lengths and provides a comprehensive and efficient strategy for voice
  cloning and out-of-domain speaking style and emotion adaptation. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of this approach for controlling fine-grained characteristics
  such as prosody and emotion. We will release our code and checkpoints. We encourage
  the reader to listen to the audio samples on our demo page: https://anonymoussbm.github.io/aaai-audio-workshop.github/'
